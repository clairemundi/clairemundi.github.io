  <button class="collapsible">Why did you pick atmospheric and oceanic science? Did you always know this is what you wanted to study? </button>
  <div class="content">
  <p>  This is a really great question, because when I was in high school I knew I really liked physics but I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my physics knowledge — there seemed to be so many options!
      I also enjoyed my chemistry and environmental science classes in high school so I thought I might do something related to those fields. I went into college thinking I would double major in physics and chemistry, but after my first chemistry class, I couldn't really imagine working in a chem lab. So I started taking more earth science classes — originally just for fun/to try something new — like climatology and remote sensing, and I realized those were a much better fit for me!
      I also distinctly remember having a conversation with my high school physics teacher, after telling her I wanted to major in physics in college, where I said that astrophysics felt “too big” and topics like quantum physics felt “too small,” so I guess I had a Goldilocks moment in realizing that Earth system-scale processes (like weather or ocean waves… things you can actually see) were much more manageable for me to think about.
      </p>
  </div>

  <button class="collapsible">I really like weather and am interested in becoming a meteorologist! How are physics and weather connected?</button>
  <div class="content">
  <p>Much of understanding weather systems is actually, secretly, just understanding physics, so it’s great that you’re interested in both!</p>
  <p>As a graduate student, I’ve taken classes such as fluid dynamics (thinking how to apply F=ma to the atmosphere and ocean) and thermodynamics (thinking about how the transfer of heat influences weather systems, like water vapor releasing heat to condense into a raindrop), so a lot of the background education you’ll need to become a meteorologist is physics-based. A lot of meteorology programs also require that you take physics courses before atmospheric science courses so that you have a good foundation.</p>
  <p>So, physics and weather are already pretty connected! It’s more so about what exactly you want to focus on in your career. Since you mentioned broadcast meteorology, radar observations are a huge part of forecasting and are a great example of how physics is used in meteorology. Radars work because they emit radiation and the rain or snow that’s in the air scatters that radiation, and based on the radiation that returns to the station, meteorologists can figure out where weather systems are located. Working with radiation falls under a field of physics called optics and in order to improve estimates of rainfall, a strong interest in the underlying physics is required. I use a lot of these same principles in my research when I analyze satellite remote sensing data. Satellites work in a similar way, collecting radiation information as they orbit Earth and then I get to use that data to answer interesting research questions!</p>
  </div>

  <button class="collapsible">How did you decide you on your research topic and which grad schools to apply to? Were there any classes that influenced your decisions? </button>
  <div class="content">
  <p>I decided to go into atmospheric science based on a number of reasons. There were definitely a few classes I took at Skidmore that helped inform this decision, like Remote Sensing and Climatology, where I realized I wanted to know more about the climate system and the data we use to discover this information. I also took a seminar class all about Antarctica, and that was how I first got interested in the polar regions. I also had a research internship that I did one summer focusing on cloud physics in the Arctic. I really enjoyed answering those kinds of questions, so I knew I wanted to do research similar to that after college. Outside of these experiences, I also found it helpful to read scientific papers and news articles to stay up-to-date on current questions other scientists are asking to see if I found any of them interesting.
  </p>
  <p> And you’re absolutely right in that choosing a graduate program is mostly based on research opportunities (and funding to a certain degree). A lot of STEM programs will offer an assistantship, which is a small stipend/salary for your research work and a lot of time this comes from a professor’s individual funding. You can also get paid to be a teaching assistant as well. So you’ll likely want to apply somewhere that has these opportunities available, in addition to having the resources to work on your dissertation. Also, some advisors already have set funding for specific projects, so if your interests align, you may be hired to work on a specific project for your dissertation. There’s also usually a bit of flexibility to add in your own research questions. That’s kind of what I did, where my advisor had funding to analyze Arctic cyclones and sea ice using satellite data and that checked all the boxes for me, including topics I was interested in and data I wanted to work with. From there I had to decide exactly what questions we’d ask and what methods we would use to try and answer them.
  </p>
  <p>Overall I think the general “pipeline,” so to speak, is thinking about what topic you want to study, then finding a faculty member with similar interests, and then reaching out to see if they have any funding available to support a graduate student. Of course, you’ll also want to pick a university somewhere that will make you happy to live near for the duration of your degree, whether that includes the weather, being close to family and friends, or what’s available to do in the town you pick.
  </p>
  </div>

  <button class="collapsible">How did you find summer research opportunites as an undergraduate?</button>
  <div class="content">
  <p> When I was in college, I did two summer research internships. The first I did in the summer between my second and third years. This was through a program called Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), funded by the National Science Foundation (https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp). They host a bunch of different internships in lots of different topics (including math!), and you can apply to work at a different university for a summer. The REU site is a very common way to find summer internships in STEM fields. </p>
  <p>My second research internship was at Skidmore, where I continued working on a research project that I started during my junior year into the summer, and then continued working on through my senior year. This was kind of a continuation of the independent-study-type work I was doing during the school year with my research advisor. So depending on the requirements of your college program, you might also be able to do research during the school year as an independent study, like you mentioned.
  </p>
  <p>There are lots of opportunities to get research experience in college, but you do need to know where to look for them. Your college advisor will likely have a list of common opportunities that students in your discipline often apply to, both in and outside of the college you’re attending.
  </p>
  </div>

  <button class="collapsible">What programming languages do you know?</button>
  <div class="content">
  <p> Really good question because I spend a lot of time coding for my job!
      I did not take any computer science classes in high school, and I got my first taste of scientific programming during my second year of college, where I took a “computational methods in physics” class. From there, most of my coding knowledge came from learning on-the-go while working on various research projects. 
  </p>
  <p>
      I first started coding using MATLAB in college (which is still preferred by some climate and engineering fields). However, in grad school, I switched over to Python since that is what a majority of scientists in my field use currently. Luckily there is a decent amount of overlap between these two languages so it wasn’t too difficult to transition! I’ve since come to appreciate the flexibility Python gives for various data projects. 
  </p>
  </div>

  <button class="collapsible">Is this a career path you were always interested in? Have you ever considered changing professions?</button>
  <div class="content">
  <p> 
  I honestly don’t know if I ever did decide for sure that I wanted a career in science. For me, I just kept taking classes that interested me and asking (and then trying to answer) questions that caught my interest. I didn’t really have a good idea of what a career as a scientist or physicist would look like growing up, but I knew that I enjoyed taking most of my science and math classes. Out of high school, I originally wanted to study chemistry, and physics was sort of a back-up plan that would help me better understand my chemistry classes. However, after taking one chemistry lab course, I realized I couldn’t really envision myself working in a chem lab. So I started taking more and more geoscience classes instead, pretty much just because they sounded cool, and began to realize how much I liked the overlaps between geo and physics. From there, I started applying to research opportunities and eventually graduate programs where I could learn more about how these two topics relate and what we could learn from studying them. Being involved in these research opportunities made me realize how much I enjoyed learning about these topics and eventually I wanted to discover new things that help build upon our current knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>
  Also when I was in college (and even now in grad school), I started getting involved more with programs related to science education, like tutoring and mentoring programs for younger students. As I continue to study scientific topics, I am becoming more and more interested in how these subjects are communicated and how to make opportunities in these fields more accessible. So I think I’ve always been interested in science careers in general, but maybe if I wasn’t doing research, I could envision myself working somewhere that works on improving science education and access to opportunities in STEM.
  </p>
  <p>
  Overall, I don't think I have any doubts about my current career path or want to change the trajectory I’m currently on. I’m mostly following what I’m interested in and those interests led me to pursue a PhD in a field combining my interests in physics and earth sciences. Although, I still have about 2 or 3 years left in graduate school, so truthfully, I’m grappling with similar questions as you are right now involving what I want to do with my degree after I graduate. I’ve been considering a few different career paths (like possibly staying in academia, or working in a larger national lab, or transitioning to industry). I really like doing research but don’t know if I’m fully ready to give up the additional roles I take on as a graduate student (in terms of mentoring and education) in a fully research-focused role. I really like where I am right now and am excited about where my education can take me in the future!
  </p>  
  <p>  
  Sorry for the long answer! In summary, I definitely recommend trying lots of things out to see what you’re interested in, and it’s really never too late to try something new. It’s also ok to have lots of different interests; there's likely a career path out there that uses all those skills. Lastly, uncertainty isn’t necessarily a bad thing -- it just means you have lots of potential opportunities ahead of you :)
  </p>
  </div>

  <button class="collapsible">Did you have a role model or specific person that helped you enter this field?</button>
  <div class="content">
  <p> 
      I don’t think there was any one person that got me into physics or that I followed into the field. Of course, I had plenty of mentors along the way that helped me navigate to where I am now. By building a network of people with similar interests, I was able to sort of hone in on what I was interested in doing in the future. For example, when I was in college, I met, and had the opportunity to work with, lots of different professors with expertise in lots of different areas. I learned about satellite remote sensing from one instructor and about polar climate from another and fluid dynamics from another. Having this network of people really helped me shape my own interests as well as help me break into the field. So while I sort of decided to enter physics by myself, having a support network of mentors helped me stay in the field and navigate my path forward.

  <h1 class="h1-main-header">About my research</h1>

  <button class="collapsible">How do you collect data for your research? Have you traveled to one of the poles?</button>
  <div class="content">
  <p>I have not yet been to either of the poles! I would absolutely love to do field work later in my career if I have the option. Currently though, I am mostly computer-bound. I use a lot of satellite data for my research, and this data is typically freely available to download online from various data centers. One of my favorite tools for looking at satellite data is NASA’s WorldView. I also plan on incorporating climate model output into my research to investigate future impacts of storms as sea ice continues to melt. All in all, my research is much heavier on data analysis than data collection since technology does all the hard work in getting the data for me!!</p>
  <p>In order to get a good picture of the system you’re studying, you definitely need all kinds of observations -- both collected in situ (at the site) and remotely (like satellite coverage), as well as numerous analysis methods and mathematical representations (like climate models). So you can sort of pick and choose what kind of data you want to work with, and so some scientists end up in the field more than others, but it’s all helpful in solving whatever research problem you’re working on!
  </p>
  </div>

  <button class="collapsible">Does increased air and ocean temperatures influence the amount of cyclones in the Arctic?</button>
  <div class="content">
  <p> One of my favorite things about the research project I’m currently working on is how interconnected all the different aspects of the climate system are. So the very, very short answer is yes, record high air and ocean temperatures are influencing much of how cyclones develop and interact with sea ice (mostly because climate change is seemingly affecting most aspects of the Arctic). However, this is a pretty active area of research so it’s still a bit early to be assigning definite trends to exactly <em>how</em> the current warming is impacting cyclone activity. </p>
  <p>That being said, there have been a few papers published within the last couple of years making the argument that the presence of less sea ice (like we’ve seen over the past several years) are related to higher cyclone counts (especially in the winter) and possibly more intense cyclones. 
  </p>
  <p>One reason cyclone intensity is increasing due to less ice present is because of the effects of surface roughness. Sea ice is fairly bumpy as different ice floes move around and bump into each other (think of how the hood of a car crumpled in an accident). However, aside from wave activity, the surface of open ocean water is pretty smooth. The roughness of sea ice can slow down wind speeds near the surface, but if the cyclone develops over an ice-free area, the surface winds can impart a greater effect on sea ice as it advances towards the ice edge.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="collapsible">What impacts the severity of a storm in the Arctic and how much the sea ice is affected?</button>
  <div class="content">
  <p> Seasonality plays an important role in how storms develop. My research focuses on summer storms, which are generally less intense than winter cold-season storms, but likely impact the sea ice more since sea ice is at its thinnest and smallest extent during warm season months. One key factor in determining storm severity is the difference in ocean temperature and air temperature. Generally, it takes longer for water to heat up than air. So in the summertime, the ocean is fairly cold and lacking heat energy to help develop the cyclone. But during winter, the ocean is still holding onto that heat, leading these storms to be more intense.
  </p>
  <p>Currently, some scientists are suggesting that the amount of sea ice present during a cyclone event actually is a very important factor, for both how the storm develops and how the cyclone affects the ice. Less sea ice present can enhance storm development through greater energy transfer with the ocean and less friction with the surface slowing down winds. This is one reason why some climate scientists are anticipating storms to become more intense in the future as Arctic sea ice continues to decline (and then the intense storms have the potential to further cause melt).
  </p>
  </div>

  <button class="collapsible">What's a feedback proccess?</button>
  <div class="content">
  <p> Much of the processes that occur in the Arctic occur as feedback processes, where a change in Thing A impacts Thing B, which impacts Thing C, which then turns around and impacts Thing A, starting the cycle all over again! This interconnectedness is a main reason why there are still so many questions surrounding processes in polar regions. </p>
  </div>

  <button class="collapsible">Have storms in the Arctic changed at all? </button>
  <div class="content">
      <p>The short answer is that climate change is definitely changing so many aspects of the Arctic, including storms. However, since a lot of the large changes have occurred fairly recently, scientists (including myself) are still trying to figure out exactly what changes we’ve observed can be attributed to the various changes global warming has caused. Current studies are thinking that storms are becoming more intense and occurring more frequently due to lower amounts of ice present, but we’ll likely need a few more years of data to confirm this trend for sure. This intensification can be attributed to a number of factors such as increased ocean temperatures or smaller ice extents during the summer, however there might be seasonal differences to how storms changed based on these factors. Also, climate change may be the cause of shift patterns in atmospheric flow that allows for cyclones near the pole to intensify. </p>
  </div>

  <button class="collapsible">What impact do a storm's clouds have on sea ice?</button>
  <div class="content">
  <p> The Arctic is a pretty cloudy place, but storms generally concentrate the clouds in one area and this limits the amount of sunlight reaching the surface. Clouds can also act like a blanket and trap heat below them, warming the surface. As for the enhanced precipitation storms often bring, snow generally helps sea ice grow and rain generally accelerates ice melt.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="collapsible">Will enough ice melt in the Arctic that storms have no effect?</button>
  <div class="content">
  <p> Another hot topic in Arctic research right now is trying to predict the timing of the Arctic’s first “ice-free” summer (“ice-free” refers to a sea ice area less than 1 million sq. km; 2023’s summer area was about 4.3 million sq. km). Some climate models have suggested that the Arctic could be seasonally ice-free by as early as the 2040s, though more realistically, a lot of projections are thinking around the 2070s. So (again, unfortunately) it’s pretty likely that we’ll see some significant ice melt within our lifetimes.  </p>
  <p>In the shorter-term, one of the main consequences of decreasing sea ice area is that sea ice acts as a barrier protecting the coast from intense waves and storm surges, so without that protection, coastal communities are a lot more vulnerable. Regardless of how cyclones themselves are changing, coastal communities will likely see impacts resulting from the loss of ice alone.
  </p>
  </div>

  <button class="collapsible">Do Arctic storms impact weather in other places?</button>
  <div class="content">
  <p> This is a really good question, and what you’re referring to is what is known as a <i>teleconnection</i>. There are many connections across different locations of Earth, where weather in one place impacts weather in another. </p>
  <p>For the Arctic, there is a climate pattern called the <u>Arctic Oscillation (AO)</u> that describes the connection between Arctic weather and weather in the mid-latitudes. When there is abnormally low pressure in the Arctic (defined by a lot of storms), pressures in the mid-latitudes are generally higher, associated with warmer and dryer weather. This is known as the positive phase of AO, and the negative phase is just the opposite! When there are generally fewer storms in the Arctic (and overall higher air pressures), colder air masses move south and the mid-latitudes tend to experience more storms.
  </p>
  <p>There is also an ongoing debate on how warming temperatures in the Arctic (which are warming 2-3 times faster than the global average through a process called Arctic Amplification) are affecting global weather patterns by weakening the temperature gradient between the generally cold polar region and the warmer tropics. But this change is still being actively studied!
